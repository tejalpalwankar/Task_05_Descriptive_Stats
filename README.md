Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse 2025 - Descriptive Statistics and LLM Validation
Overview
This project analyzes the 2025 Syracuse University Women’s Lacrosse dataset using Python and compares statistical answers with those generated by a Large Language Model (ChatGPT). The goal is to explore the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs in answering natural language questions based on real sports data.

Dataset
The analysis uses four CSV files from the 2025 season:

Player_Statistics.csv

Goals_Statistics.csv

Schedule.csv

Team_Statistics.csv

Note: The dataset files themselves are not included in this repo per assignment instructions.

Approach
Loaded and cleaned the dataset using Python's pandas.

Computed descriptive statistics and advanced metrics (e.g., most efficient scorer, turnover rates).

Created Python scripts/notebooks to answer common and analytic questions.

Posed identical questions to ChatGPT with structured prompts.

Compared and validated answers from Python against ChatGPT output.

Produced basic visualizations such as bar charts of top goal scorers.

Key Findings
ChatGPT matched Python results accurately for straightforward stats such as total games played, top scorers, assists, and points.

Minor discrepancies were observed in aggregate totals and more advanced metrics due to data filtering, metric interpretation, or prompt clarity.

Advanced analytics questions require precise definition and data preprocessing to ensure consistent results from LLMs.
